# Invent an Imaginary Embedded System

## Food Printer

This device prints the any food you can imagine. It can be fast food such as a McDonald's burger or any other type of meal. The food printer would have the same form factor as a microwave. You would insert some sort of packaged food material into the microwave. The food will print based on the type of material put in the printer. For instance you can print a Big Mac if you have a Big Mac food sample.
