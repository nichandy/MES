# Invent an Imaginary Embedded System

## Food Printer

This device prints the any food you can imagine. It can be food such as a McDonald's burger, personal pizza, etc. The printer would have the same form factor as a microwave. The food you can print will come in a small package that you can insert into the microwave. For instance you can print a Big Mac if you have a Big Mac food sample. Hit the print button on the food printer and then the desired food magically appears.
